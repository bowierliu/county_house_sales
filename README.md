# King County House Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes house sales data in King County using a combination of Tableau for data visualization and Excel for data preprocessing and exploration. The main objective is to uncover patterns and trends in house prices and other related features.

The project leverages the dataset provided in the `HouseData.xlsx` file and visualizes the data in a Tableau Workbook (`KING COUNTY HOUSE SALES.twb`). These files contain various features about properties, such as price, number of bedrooms, square footage, and more, all within King County.

## Files in the Repository

- **HouseData.xlsx**: This Excel file contains raw data on house sales in King County. The file includes details such as:
  - `Price`: The sale price of the house.
  - `Bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the house.
  - `Bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms.
  - `Sqft_living`: The square footage of the living space.
  - `Condition`: The overall condition of the house.
  - Other attributes such as year built, location, and more.

- **KING COUNTY HOUSE SALES.twb**: This Tableau workbook contains visualizations and insights derived from the data. The Tableau workbook includes several dashboards that allow for interactive exploration of house sales trends, comparisons between neighborhoods, and other key insights.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the characteristics of the housing market in King County by analyzing key features such as house prices, sizes, conditions, and geographical locations.
   
2. **Data Visualization**: Using Tableau to create dynamic and insightful visualizations to uncover patterns in the housing market, compare property features, and predict pricing trends.
